# BURGLAR-ALARM-SYSTEM
This project is a simple burglar alarm system designed in Tinkercad using basic logic gates and a buzzer. The system monitors four input conditions and triggers an alarm if any of the conditions are met. This project is a practical application of digital electronics principles, using Karnaugh maps and logic gates to design a functional security system.

Logic Gates: AND,NOT gates are used to simulate the alarm system's logic.
Buzzer: The alarm is triggered through a buzzer when certain conditions are met.
Four Possible Cases: The system considers four input scenarios, each of which could trigger the alarm.
